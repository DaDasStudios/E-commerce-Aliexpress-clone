# Aliexpress clone / E-commerce project
For put into action the concepts learned about front-end development, I thought it's a nice idea to replicate the homepage of Aliexpress.
To do this, I implemented the concepts  of below:

> This project was born to only replicate the appierance of the webpage, however it evolved to a better insight more complex

## Getting started
This project joins all the main concepts of a **e-commerce** real project:

* A custom CSS for a better management of the styles in order to clone the apperience of _Aliexpress_ exactly like it looks like
* The folder structure is oriented to a real project, so that is made up of a recursive structure inside the folders
* An interactive and dynamic GUI with a bunch of componenets separed by folders according their type
* Usage of __Typescript__ in order to avoid type-errors and, instead handle the data-flow of the project properly
* Consuming a **REST API** to get the products attributes like it was a common e-commerce webpage
* Formatting of currency and  selection of languages to choose at the navbar

## Folder structure
As you can see, the structure of the project is *recursive*, I mean, every GUI folder has a set of `util` and `components` folder; it doesn't matter 
if not used, but the usage is available.
